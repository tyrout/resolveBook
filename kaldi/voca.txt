  Let’s Talk about Speech Recognition
  In general Speech Recognition framework: 
  1. Process incoming wav speech 
  2. Than from wave signal , we extract acoustic features using acoustic model 
  3. Linking those features to words or vocabulary or lexicon 
  4. Language model or grammar defines how words can be connected to each.


    - acoustic model : 
      An acoustic model is used in automatic speech recognition to represent the relationship between an audio signal and the phonemes or other linguistic units that make up speech. 
      The model is learned from a set of audio recordings and their corresponding transcripts. 
      It is created by taking audio recordings of speech, and their text transcriptions, and using software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word.

      -> 여기서 말하는 'software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word' 가 kaldi 인듯
